# SICK TDC-E Developer's Documentation

## Welcome!

This is the SICK TDC-E Developer's Documentation, aimed at customers, users and developers alike to explore the TDC-E's options, capabilities and programmability. We want the user to get to know the TDC-E device so that its wide variety of options could be used to their full extent. To that end, the Developer's Documentation servers as a guide which contains the following file structure:

- TDC-E Configuration
  - Network Configuration
  - Interface Container Configuration
- Getting Started
- Development Documentation
  - With Hardware Interface
  - Without Hardware Interface
- Examples

The TDC-E Configuration section explores the configuration of the network and interface container used by the TDC-E device. DETAILS Find out more by clicking [here](https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_tdc-e-developers-documentation/wiki/TDC%E2%80%90E-Configuration).

Getting Started is a section that serves as an introduction to code development and deploying applications. In it, you can find different kinds of beginner examples which can help you get started on your journey with the TDC-E in hand. To check out this part of the documentation, click [here](https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_tdc-e-developers-documentation/wiki/Getting-Started).

The Development Documentation is made to demonstrate development in deifferent kinds of programming languages by providing descriptions and explanations of code linked to the Examples folder. It serves as a how-to guide in order to inform of coding descriptions and tactics while developing an application that is going to be deployed to the TDC-E. This part has two subsections: development with, and without the hardware interface. Programming with both has its strengths and weaknesses which will be pointed to in this section. All explanations are linked to their corresponding examples. To find out more about the Development Documentation, click [here](https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_tdc-e-developers-documentation/wiki/Development-Documentation).

The Examples can be found on the first page of the documentation. It contains all kinds of examples on how to work with a specific service or interface, and is written in the programming languages Go, Node-RED, Python.
